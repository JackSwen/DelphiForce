  | DelPhi, originally developed in Barry Honig's lab, solves     | 
  | the Poisson-Boltzmann equation in 3D grid by using            | 
  | Finite-Difference method. It allows for assigning various     | 
  | dielectric regions and applying different boundary conditions.| 
  | The calculated energy components are less grid dependent      | 
  | due to induced surface charges method implemented in DelPhi.  | 
  |                                                               | 
  | The new version DelPhi C++ beta, is object oriented package   | 
  | complemented with OpenMP and improved speed and memory usage. | 
  |                                                               |
